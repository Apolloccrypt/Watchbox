Vintage Seiko watches are cherished for their durability, timeless design, and rich history. Restoring these classics not only preserves their legacy but also creates a rewarding project for collectors.

## Step 1: Disassembly
Carefully open the case and disassemble the components, ensuring you keep track of each part. A clean workspace is crucial.

## Step 2: Cleaning
Use a watch cleaning solution and ultrasonic cleaner for the movement. Hand-polish the case to remove scratches without over-polishing.

## Step 3: Reassembly
Reassemble the cleaned and repaired parts, lubricate the movement, and test the watch for accuracy.
