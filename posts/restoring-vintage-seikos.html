      <p>Vintage Seiko watches are cherished for their durability, timeless design, and rich history...</p>
      <h2>Step 1: Check with seller if the watch runs</h2>
      <p>Usually this is already mentioned in the description.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Checking the value online for a fair bid</h2>      
      <p>Using google lens + the caseback number, you can quickly find pricing. Keep in mind that vintage pieces vary due to the state of the watch, completion of the set (box/papers) and rarity. But we only focus on the watch itself for now and herefor ebay and chrono24 are reasonable price indicators, although chrono24 often shows a too high price, since they mostly are services and these costs are included in the price.</p>

      <h4>Step 3: Receiving the watch</h2>      
      <p>Checking if the watch runs by either carefully shaking the watch if it's an automatic or winding when its a handwinder. Check the time + date setting and if all is OK, you have found a rough gem!</p>

      <h5>Step 4: Polishing the crystal</h2>      
      <p> 90% of the time vintage Seiko's have mineral crystals which can be polished with simple toothpaste. By taking a cloth and rubbing the pea sised bit of toothpaste on the crystal without too much pressure, any marks that are not cracks, will slowly disappear! Now with a mildly damp cloth or cleaning towel, remove the paste to see your progress. Keep in mind not to get any water or wet stuff near the crown. After this we can consider polishing the case.</p>
