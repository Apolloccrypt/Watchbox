      <p>Vintage Seiko watches are cherished for their durability, timeless design, and rich history. Restoring these timepieces is not only about bringing them back to life, but also about preserving their heritage. In this guide, I’ll walk you through the essential steps for restoring a vintage Seiko watch to its former glory.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Check with seller if the watch runs</h2>
      <p>Usually, this is already mentioned in the description. If the watch runs, you’re off to a great start. However, be sure to ask the seller about the condition of the movement, and whether it’s running properly. Sometimes, watches are listed as "not running" because of a simple issue that can be easily fixed.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Checking the value online for a fair bid</h3>      
      <p>Using Google Lens and the caseback number, you can quickly find pricing. Keep in mind that vintage pieces vary due to the state of the watch, completion of the set (box/papers), and rarity. For now, we’re focusing only on the watch itself, and both eBay and Chrono24 are reasonable price indicators. However, Chrono24 can sometimes show inflated prices due to included services, so be cautious.</p>

      <h4>Step 3: Receiving the watch</h4>      
      <p>Once the watch arrives, the first thing you need to do is check if it runs. For automatic watches, carefully shake it to see if the movement activates. For hand-wound watches, simply wind it up. If the time and date settings are functional, then you’ve already scored a rough gem!</p>

      <h5>Step 4: Polishing the crystal</h5>      
      <p>90% of the time, vintage Seiko watches have mineral crystals that can be polished with simple toothpaste. Apply a pea-sized amount of toothpaste to a cloth, and gently rub it into the crystal using circular motions. Avoid using too much pressure. Afterward, dampen a cloth or cleaning towel to remove the paste and check your progress. Be careful not to get any moisture near the crown or the movement.</p>

      <h6>Step 5: Polishing the case</h6>      
      <p>If the case of the Seiko has visible scratches, you can polish it as well. Use a gentle polishing compound and a microfiber cloth. Avoid aggressive polishing, as you could damage the finish. Light polishing can really bring out the beauty of a vintage Seiko watch!</p>
